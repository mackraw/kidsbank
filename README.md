# Kids' Bank

The idea behind Kids' Bank is that kids learn about money using cash (think pocket money, piggy banks). However, as young adults they enter the world of cashless transactions (online bank accounts, paying with plastic). 

Kids' Bank attempts to fill the void by letting kids and teenagers record their pocket money transactions in their personal mock bank accounts.

## How it works

- Register to start creating your mock bank accounts. You can choose from Checking, Savings, and Credit Card.
- Each account type has an appropriate interest rate bracket to choose from.
- If you make a purchase, record a transaction. It'll show on your bank account history.
- Pay off balance on your Credit Card accounts to avoid interest charge on the 1st of every month.

## Bonus feature
- Find banks based on your location or a search query. Uses your browser's Geolocation API and the LocationIQ API.
